**QuACKER** – *Questionably Accurate Course Knowledge, Evaluation, & Ratings*

QuACKER is a lightweight, web-based platform that helps students explore, evaluate, and review courses. Instead of hunting for recommendations from peers, Reddit threads, or RateMyProfessor, QuACKER centralizes all the key course information in **one place**: easiness, usefulness, workload, attendance requirements, average grades, and anonymous reviews.

QuACKER embodies the **Retro v Modern** theme: it’s inspired by the old-school ritual of asking classmates for advice, but built using **modern web tech and AI** for a fast, interactive experience.

* **Browser-Based:** No backend server required, hosted on GitHub Pages

## Inspiration

Choosing courses is a pain point for students everywhere. Before QuACKER, students often:

* Asked peers for advice
* Scrolled through Reddit threads for tips

QuACKER **simplifies this process**, making it faster and more reliable to research courses before registering. It captures the nostalgia of peer recommendations while leveraging **modern technology and AI** to present information clearly and efficiently.

## Hack RPI Prize Submissions

**Best .Tech Domain Name:**
QuACKER takes the old-school idea of asking peers for course advice and modernizes it with a sleek web interface. A **.Tech domain name** would make QuACKER permanent and shareable, while **Blue Snowball mics** would help the team collaborate seamlessly to expand features and improve the platform.

**Best Use of Gemini API:**
QuACKER combines retro student wisdom with modern AI. Using **Google Gemini**, we generated the frontend and Firebase integration for **anonymous course reviews and rankings**, turning scattered student opinions into a single, interactive platform. Gemini allowed us to build a fully functional application over the hackathon weekend, bringing the past into the present.
